# dirty-bird-builder


Same idea as what I was doing with bird-brain, starting from scratch.

Need to think from the start of how to make code more reusable.

The assets folder contains images for the game

Need to refactor both Tile and TileLanding to 
display up to three cheeses on top of meat.

Both Tile and Tile landing are container
elements with up to four inner elements: 
choice of meat and up to three cheeses.

HT of each inner element should change dynamically
to fill entire Tile/TileLanding container.

Remove txt from chz imgs, use imgs of real chz
